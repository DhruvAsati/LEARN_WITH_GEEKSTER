#Card Section
In the next section, we have a card section where we have taken 100% width and 50vh height.

-inside it, we have created other 4 sections for the card layout and for each of the 4 sections there is another div which contains the content of the card heading, image, and link
- then we have given the transform effect in the  content with scale property for 1.1, 1.1 on the X and Y axis so hovering the card will make a zoom effect.
- inside content, we have a shop now which has a hover effect on color and underline.<br>
